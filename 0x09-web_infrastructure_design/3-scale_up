Explanation for Additional Elements:

Additional Server (Server 3 - Database): By splitting the database onto its own server (Server 3), 
we can optimize database performance and separation of concerns. This approach also prevents resource contention 
between the application and database servers.

Load Balancer (HAProxy): The load balancer is added to ensure even distribution of incoming traffic between the web server 
and the application server. It balances the load across the two servers, preventing one server from becoming overwhelmed 
and improving overall performance.

By separating the components onto different servers, we achieve better resource isolation, making it easier to manage 
and scale each component independently based on its unique requirements.

Benefits of This Infrastructure:

Scalability: With separate servers for each component, we can scale each part of the infrastructure independently.
For example, if the database becomes a bottleneck, we can add more resources to Server 3 or
consider sharding the database to distribute the load.

Fault Isolation: If any component (web server, application server, or database) fails, the other
components can continue to function. For example, if the application server experiences an issue,
the web server can still serve static content and show error pages to users while the problem is resolved.

High Availability: The cluster configuration of the load balancer provides high availability. 
If one instance of the load balancer fails, the other instance can continue to route traffic to the available servers.

Better Security: Separating the web server, application server, and database on different servers can improve security. 
Each component can have its own set of security configurations, reducing the attack surface.

Performance: By distributing the load between the web server and the application server, we can achieve better performance 
and handle more concurrent users.

Overall, this infrastructure design provides a scalable, fault-tolerant, and secure setup to host the website www.foobar.com effectively.
